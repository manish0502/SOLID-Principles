/**
 * Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Definition:
   Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

In Simple Terms:
    It's better to have several small, specific interfaces than a large, general-purpose one.
    Classes should only implement methods that are relevant to them.
